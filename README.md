# `battery`

The battery tool will attempt to read your first battery and print it's charge
percentage and status to STDOUT.

## Build and Install
A Makefile is provided for easy installation. You can use it to tweak the
install path and compiler flags. If you know of a distribution package get in
touch and I will add a note here.
```
make
sudo make install
```
